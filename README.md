In this work, encryption and decryption of files using bit wise xor of ascii values is done using the secret key generated by Diffie hellman.We start with implementation of algorithm i.e, by building up a mutual secret between two gatherings that can be utilized for secret communication 
for exchanging information over a public channel. Then with the generated secret key , file is encrypted and decrypted# Diffie-Hellman-Key-Exchange.
